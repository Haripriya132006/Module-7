### 📘 Module 7 – C Programming Exercises
## 📁 Repository Overview
This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises designed to reinforce understanding of fundamental concepts such as:

User-defined data types

Enumerations

File handling

Typedef usage

Menu-driven programs

Each exercise is documented with its corresponding code and explanations to aid in learning and comprehension.

## 📄 Contents
user_defined_data_types.md: Demonstrates the use of nested structures to store and display person details like name, age, and address.

arithmetic_operations_using_typedef.md: Implements a menu-driven program using typedef for performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

file_handelling.md: Illustrates file handling by writing and reading marks to/from a file named marks.txt.

ennumeration.md: Utilizes enumeration to display class timings for different hours.

Images: Includes relevant images (image.png, image-1.png, image-2.png, image-3.png) to visualize outputs or provide additional context.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
To explore and run the programs:

# Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Haripriya132006/Module-7.git
Navigate to the Directory:

cd Module-7
```
# Compile and Run:

Use a C compiler like gcc to compile the .c files.

Example:
```
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```
Note: Replace filename.c with the actual C file name you wish to compile.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By engaging with these exercises, learners will:

Understand and implement user-defined data types and nested structures.

Utilize typedef to create more readable and maintainable code.

Perform file operations such as reading from and writing to files.

Apply enumerations to represent a set of named integer constants.

Develop menu-driven programs to interact with users effectively.
